          Hello, I'm Arthur, a tech and innovation enthusiast currently studying 
          Computer Science at Pontifical Catholic University of Paran√° (PUCPR).
            
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My interest in games has always motivated me to explore how they are made, which eventually led me to programming. 
          After that initial contact, I began to delve into the various areas that this field offers. Here, I present some of 
          the projects I developed throughout my learning journey.
